## About
I have a background in Medical Science and I am currently in the process of completing my graduate diploma in data science. Throughout this degree, I have developed skills and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and patterns. I am exctied to apply my analytical skills in the data analytics field as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I gained the skills to clean and process complex data and be able to recognise patterns and trends, through exploratory data analysis. Whether I'm working independently or in a team environment, the excitement of uncovering new insights and solving complex problems through data analysis motivates me.
