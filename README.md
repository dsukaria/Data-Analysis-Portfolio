## About
I have a background in Medical Science and I am currently in the process of completing my graduate diploma in data science. Throughout this degree, I have developed skills and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights and patterns. I am excited to apply my analytical skills in the data analytics field as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I gained the skills to clean and process complex data and be able to recognise patterns and trends, through exploratory data analysis. Whether I'm working independently or in a team environment, the excitement of uncovering new insights and solving complex problems through data analysis motivates me.


## Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### A Data-Driven Analysis of Movie Success
**Code:** [A Data-Driven Analysis of Movie Success.ipynb](https://github.com/dsukaria/Projects/blob/main/A%20Data-Driven%20Analysis%20of%20Movie%20Success.ipynb)

**Goal:** By performing a data analysis using Python, the aim of this project is to identify and understand the key factors that contribute to a movie's financial success, by analysing factors such as budget, running time and the release dates to uncover patterns and insights.

**Description:**

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** This analysis revealed that the most signficant factors which contribute to the success of a movie were the movie's domestic opening, as well as the budget.
